no need of logic from parent
logic should come only from child

======> method overriding [replace the parent logic]
parent and child class will have the same methodName + same method signature 
but with diff logic. Two classes involved- parent class, child class. Both the class have same method
name and same method signature with different logic.

In method overloading only one class involved, within the same class we have
different methods with the same name, with different method signature.
