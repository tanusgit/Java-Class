 Serialization:
----------------
-> process for storing object state in the file system or when we 
need to send object over the network..

Serialization:
class has to implement serializable interface

public class Student implements Serializable{
}

interview question:
how to deserialize
marker interface is serializable interface because we are not overriding any method
this interface only provides the information to the compiler
Serialize:
    1.create file object
    2.FileOutputStream
    3.ObjectOutputStream
    4.use writeObject method to serialize

  Deserialize:
     1.create file object
    2.FileInputream
    3.ObjectInput
    4.use readObject method to serialize
