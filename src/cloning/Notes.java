/*
 cloning: we are creating object using another object
 both the objects are independent which means if we change one object it will not 
 change the other objects
 old object and new object have the same data
 steps for cloning:
 1. class has to implement clonable interface
 2. it has to override the clone method
 
 how do you create the clone object:
 
 Employee ei = new Employee();
 e1.setId(2);
 e1.setNmae("Ram");
 
 Employee c2 = (Employee)e1.clone();
 
 when we use clone() it throws exception so we need to use try catch block
 around the new object or we can use throws keyword this way in our main method
 public static void main(String[] args) throws  CloneNotSupportedException
