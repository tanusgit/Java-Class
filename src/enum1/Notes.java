->Enum is also a class
->For enum  we cannot create the object
enum has predefined objects
enum has limited objects

predefined objects should be mentioned in the enum class.
	
Class - > i.v + i.m + constructor +setters +getters + static
  Enum -> i.v. + i.m + constructor  + +setters +getters  + static +predefined 
  objects..
	
enum is like a dropdown and class is like a text file

 ex: LoanType , UserType , CardType , PaymentMode ,
 Enum can be used as contants
 class with fixed numbers of objects is enums
 
 
 how to get all the objects:
 //get all objs
		ColorType[] objs = ColorType.values();
		for(ColorType obj :objs) {
			System.out.println(obj);

}
