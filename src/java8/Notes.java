/*
 * java 8 is used to reduce the line of codes.
 * 1.
 * An interface will contain abstract method + default methods + static methods
 * for a child class overriding the default method is optional but overriding the 
 * abstract method is mandatory
 * 
 * 2. functional interface
 * 3. lambda functions 
 * advantage of lambda function:
 * allows functional programming.
  readable and concise code
  easier to use APIs and libraries.
  enables support for parallel processing.
  
  
  lambda can be used only if there is only one method -- used in functional interface
 *
