package abstractClass;

public class Notes {
	/*
	 * abstract class:
	 * always a parent class
	 * we cannot create any object of this class
-> should be used only in inherience.

->syntax for abstract clasS:
public abstract class RBI{
abstract method only have method signature
non abstract method have method body + signature
abstract method only statys in abstract class

Abstract class has two types of methods:
   1. Non abstract methods  (method declaration + method body)
   public void display(){
   
   }
   2. abstract methods (has only method declaration ; abstract method does not have any logic)
   public abstract void display1();
   
   If a class has one abstract method then class has to be abstract class...
	
--> create a class that extends the Abstract class [ only way to use abstract class]  
-->  For a child class overriding is mandatory for the abstract methods, 


 CREATE CHILD CLASS FOR ABSTRACT CLASS
public class SBI extends RBI{
  // Overriding the display1 method is mandatory 
  
  public abstract void display1(){
  
  }
}
	 *
	 *
	 */

}
